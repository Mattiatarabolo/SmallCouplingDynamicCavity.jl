## Modifications

The original contact data are collected over a period of several days, with a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. This allows for data aggregation over coarse-grained time windows of a preferred size $\tau_w$. In this study, time windows with sizes $\tau_w$ ranging from 3 hours to a day are considered, resulting in $T$ time steps ranging from a minimum of 12 to a maximum of 36 steps. 

During the coarse-graining procedure:
- The number $c_{ij}^t$ of contacts between individuals $i$ and $j$ occurring in a time window $t$ of size $\tau_w$ is computed.
- This value is used to estimate the infection probability $\lambda_{ij}^t$ between the two individuals at time step $t$ as:
  \[
  \lambda_{ij}^t = 1 - (1 - \gamma)^{c_{ij}^t}
  \]
  where $\gamma$ is a common parameter describing the infectiousness of a single contact.

These modifications are tailored for studying the dynamics of infection spread in coarse-grained temporal networks.
